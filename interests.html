        <p>As mentioned before, I have a variety of interests/hobbies. I like sports in general but the sport I prefer the most is soccer. I'm a video game enthusiast, the current game I'm trying to finish is Dark Souls Remastered (I just wish I had more time to play). I prefer any game genre, I'm open to any game as long as it's fun and interesting to invest time in. I like learning new things, especially anything tech related. I own a 3D printer and occasionally I make it print random stuff (a pencil holder, etc).</p>
